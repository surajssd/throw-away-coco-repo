Confidential Containers is an open source community working to leverage [Trusted Execution Environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment) to protect containers and data and to deliver cloud native confidential computing.

**We have a new release every 6 weeks!**
See [Release Notes](./releases/) or [Quickstart Guide](./quickstart.md)

- A trust model which separates Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) from guest applications

- Least privilege principles for the Kubernetes cluster administration capabilities which impact delivering Confidential Computing for guest applications or data inside the TEE
